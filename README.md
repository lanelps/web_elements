# web_elements

This is a repo for all my experimental CSS elements.

When cloning, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. Then `yarn start` to start up the server.

Not entirely sure if it's necessary but I've used Webpack to bundle everything.
It's helped me learn more about how Webpack bundles my React code for use on GitHub pages

The current goal and challenge I have set for myself by setting up this repo, is to post weekly (Ideally daily) to this repo with a new css web element. By setting this challenge I should learn a lot about css.
